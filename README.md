# WeInsure – Medical Insurance Cost Prediction 💡

An interactive machine learning project to predict medical insurance charges based on user input features like age, BMI, region, and smoking status.


## 🔍 Overview
This project explores the factors that influence insurance pricing and builds regression models to predict individual insurance costs. It includes an interactive Jupyter Notebook interface using `ipywidgets` for real-time predictions.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and includes 7 features:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Children
- Smoker
- Region
- Charges (target)
---
## 🧠 ML Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
---
## 🛠️ Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Model training and evaluation (R², MAE, RMSE)
- Interactive prediction using `ipywidgets`
- Feature importance visualization

--- 

## 💡 Key Insights
- Smoking status and BMI are the most influential factors.
- Tree-based models (XGBoost) performed best on evaluation metrics.
